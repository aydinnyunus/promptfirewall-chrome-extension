# Prompt Firewall Chrome Extension v0.0.11

## Overview

Enhance your digital security with the Prompt Firewall, a cutting-edge Chrome extension designed to protect your sensitive personal information. Tailored for both individual and business use, this extension is especially effective when interacting with Large Language Models like ChatGPT.

## Features

- **PII Detection**: Our algorithms vigilantly detect Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as IBAN Codes, Phone Numbers, Crypto Addresses, Credit Card Numbers, Email Addresses, and Secret Keys. An alert system immediately informs you of any detected PII, adding a robust layer of privacy protection.
- **Plugin Guard**: Secure against various injection attacks with our Plugin Guard feature.
- **Synthetic Data Protection**: We prioritize your privacy by using synthetic data, a technique where artificial data is generated based on real data. This ensures the confidentiality and security of your real data when using Large Language Models.
- **Local Operation**: Your privacy is our priority. The Prompt Firewall operates entirely locally, ensuring that your private data remains just that â€“ private. No external transmission of your data occurs.
